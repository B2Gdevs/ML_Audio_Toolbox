# ML_Audio_Toolbox
This repo is for a gui for Audio Feature extraction and classification.  I am hoping to add more functionality when I can.  Right now it is halfway finished, but does an ok job.
The GUI uses PyQt5 and the audio feature extraction uses PyAudioAnalysis.  If you intend to use this, please note that PyAudioAnalysis needs to use python 2 and not python 3.  Also if anyone wants to contribute please send a pull request.
