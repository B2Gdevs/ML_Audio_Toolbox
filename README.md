# ML_Audio_Toolbox
This repo is for a gui for Audio Feature extraction and classification.  I am hoping to add more functionality when I can.  Right now it is halfway finished, but does an ok job.
The GUI uses PyQt5 and the audio feature extraction uses PyAudioAnalysis.  If you intend to use this, please note that PyAudioAnalysis needs to use python 2 and not python 3. 

This application was originally used in a machine learning class wehre I was detecting the gender of participants by their voices.  This has gone further in to a research study where this application is used to train and predict if a person is stressed given the sound of there voice.

# Abandoned Project
This project is abandoned as I do not want to have to rely on Python 2 anymore and I also do not have the time to continue working on this.
